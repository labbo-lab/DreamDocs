# Exclamation Marks!

Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!
```java
print("Hello world")!
```

If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!
```java
print("Hello world")!!!
```

If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.
```java
print("Hello world")?

/* 
Line #: 10
Code: print("Hello world")?
Execution Time: 152ms
Length: 21 characters
Size: 21 bytes
Method: 
Console output: "Hello world"
 */
```


You might be wondering what DreamBerd uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead. 
```java
if (;false) {
   print("Hello world")!
}
```
